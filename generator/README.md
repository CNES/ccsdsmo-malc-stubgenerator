CNES MO C Stub Generator
========================

This generator creates stub and encoding code according to:
- the MAL/C draft mapping specifications of the CNES
- the mal binary encoding from the MAL SPP specifications
- the mal split binary encoding from the MAL/TCP specifications.

The framework CCSDS_MO_StubGenerator from ESA is reused, but changes are required.
A pull request has been issued so that the changes are committed in the reference project.
In the meantime, the project should be drawn from the branch: https://github.com/lacourte/CCSDS_MO_StubGenerator.
